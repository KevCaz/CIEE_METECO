# Empirical paper using Switzerland invertebrates data (Florian Altermatt)

## Ecological question
How can a meta-ecosystem framework can help us better understand the river network?

### Sub-question
- Can defining the fluxes within and across ecosystems help better understand (and predict?) river ecosystems?

## Getting information for non-river ecosystems

Use literature to get a range of flux information for non-river ecosystems

## Organization of ecoystems

- H
  - Divided in different functional groups organised using traits
    - We can think of Emergent and aquatic
- A
  - We do not seem to have this information
- D (detrivores)
  - This should be consider at the same level of A
- N
  - This is essentially land use
  - Use hydrological model to relate from land use to biology
  - Use information on emergent (mostly) and aquatic (a little bit) to relate from biology to land use



## Journal to consider for the empirical paper

- Global Ecology and Biogeography
- Ecography
