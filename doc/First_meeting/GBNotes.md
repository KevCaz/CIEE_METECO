# Sythesis


## Questions:

  - Identifying key concept that are missing to use meta-ecoystems in an conservation perspective. In other words, how can we apply meta-ecoystems theory in conservation.
  - Is meta-ecoystem theory useful can be use for conservation perspective ?
  - Can meta-ecosystem theory inform conservation practice ? From terrestrial to aquatic systems and back

## Core concepts

- Directionality of effects
  - Boundary (ecotone)
- Local vs regional
  - What is happening locally may influence what is happening regionally down stream
  - Aquatic and terrestrial interactions
    - Position in network
    - Complexity of network
- Cummulative effect taking into account directionality

# Metaecosystem

## Basis of Meta* theories

### Spatiotemporal
- Within and across
- Local and regional scale
- Directionality of effects
  - Active vs passive flow
- Synchronicity
  - Continuous vs pulse

## Basis of Ecosystem
- Biotic < --- > abiotic
- Cycling and recycling of nutrient by going from biotic to abiotic and back
- one vs multiple nutrient

## Variability
- Baseline
- Local adaptation

## Listing perturbations that may influence meta-ecosystems in a conservation context

- Land use change
- Warming

## Organisation of my thoughts and of the system:

1. Stochiometry influence organisms in space and time
2. Can be measured using stable isotope mixing models
3. Stable isotope : You are what you eat
4. This can be quantified for many species, leading to study
  a. metacommunity level
  b. community level
  c. metapopulation level
  d. population level
5. At this point this would allow to evaluate the different stable states for our meta-ecosystem

## Response variables

It could be a rate of change of:

- alpha diversity
- beta diversity
- Ecosystem function
- Number of interactions among species (or population)
- Stochiometry variation
- Primary production
- Water quality index *
- Nutrient content
- Recreational services (e.g. fishing)
- All
- None

Spatial scale and connexion

The idea would be to work at the landscape perspective

# Pitch

- Link metaecosystem theory to conservation and policy

## Paper idea

- Present conceptual idea of meta-ecosystem theory in a conservation context
- A few example to illustrate how the meta-ecosystem concept can be applied
- Show match and mismatch
- Develop the meta-ecosystem theory around the applied discovery for better conservation practices
- Propose a null model
  - Not very clear yet... entropy perspective (?)
  - Stable variation around the rate of change to maintain a dynamic equilibrium (the cycling) (?)
  - The flow of input (nutrient) is distributed homogeneously given a predefine rate of flow
  - Constant rate of diffusion would be a basic null model
- Define some idea variability that can be used in a conservation perspective

## Modelling background
$y ~ \text{fluxes}(t)$

Fluxes depend on:
- Within and across
- Local and regional scale
- Directionality of effects
- Synchronicity
- ...

### Math behind the model

$$\mathbf{M}\otimes\mathbf{C}$$

$\mathbf{M}$ is a "from node" by "to node" matrix presenting the spatial
structure of the metacommunity and how each node influence other nodes. The
nodes can be spatial sampling points but they can also present (and this is just
an idea for now) the different ecosystem considered (e.g. forest, river,
riparian).

As for $\mathbf{C}$ it presents how the different levels in the trophic system
are connected and related. Note that $\mathbf{C}$ can be a species by species
matrix but it can also be water quality (i.e. a single value).

$y$ could be something like $\dfrac{dN}{dt}$

# Take home messages for the paper

- Fluxes are a key in using meta-ecosystem in practice
- Fluxes variation are important and the are function of the components of meta-ecosystem
  - The idea is that $\dfrac{dN}{dt} = fluxes(ME components) + Environment + Space$
- Multi-layered (and hierarchical) network
- Meta-ecosystem has focussed to much on idealized topology (this is linked with the previous point)
- The meta-ecosystem theory can (!) be applied to real ecological system without giving up generality
- Functions need to be studied at the ecosystem level not at the BEF level
